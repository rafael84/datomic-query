;; DATABASE     In Datomic, a database comprised of a set of datoms.
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; DATOMS       An immutable atomic fact that represents the addition or retraction of a
;;              relation between an entity, an attribute, a value, and a transaction.
;;
;;              A datom is expressed as a five-tuple:
;;              * an entity id (E)
;;              * an attribute (A)
;;              * a value for the attribute (V)
;;              * a transaction id (Tx)
;;              * a boolean (Op) indicating whether the datom is being added or retracted
;;
;;              Example Datom:
;;              E     42
;;              A     :user/favorite-color
;;              V     :blue
;;              Tx    1234
;;              Op    true
;; -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;; ENTITIES     An entity is a set of datoms that are all about the same E.
;;
;;              Example Entity:
;;              E     A                        V      Tx    Op
;;              42    :user/favorite-color    :blue   1234  true
;;              42    :user/first-name        "John"  1234  true
;;              42    :user/last-name         "Doe"   1234  true
;;              42    :user/favorite-color    :green  4567  true
;;              42    :user/favorite-color    :blue   4567  false
