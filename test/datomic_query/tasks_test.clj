;; BASICS
;;
;;         Datomic is a database system that stores data as immutable facts,
;;         which are called "datoms".
;;
;;         A datom represents a piece of information in the form of a tuple
;;         with four components:
;;
;;           - Entity ID:       a unique identifier for the entity that the
;;                              datom pertains to.
;;
;;           - Attribute ID:    a unique identifier for the attribute that
;;                              the datom pertains to.
;;
;;           - Value:           the value of the attribute for the entity.
;;
;;           - Transaction ID:  a unique identifier for the transaction that
;;                              added the datom to the database.
;;
;;         The combination of these four components forms a unique identifier
;;         for each datom in the database.
;;
;;         Datoms are always added to the database as part of a transaction,
;;         and once added, they cannot be modified or deleted.
